Welcome to Caffery Yang's personal website. I am a PhD student in statistics at Texas A&M University. My research focuses on developing novel statistical methods and open-source software for analyzing microbiome and multi-omics data. These studies often involve high-dimensional longitudinal data collected from various sources, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and metabolomics. By creating cutting-edge analytical tools, I aim to extract valuable insights from these complex data to advance our understanding of the role of the microbiome in human health and diseases.

I am passionate about statistical computing and committed to developing user-friendly software to facilitate the broad adoption of advanced statistical methods.

I am always eager to collaborate with experimental and computational scientists on exciting microbiome and multi-omics projects. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to work together or discuss potential collaborations. I am also happy to share my experience and insights on biostatistics and data science career development with aspiring students and junior researchers.
