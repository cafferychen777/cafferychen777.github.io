I am highly open to and enthusiastic about collaborative opportunities, particularly in:

- Microbiome data analysis
- Multi-omics analysis
- Single-cell analysis
- Spatial transcriptomics data analysis

With significant experience in tools like ggpicrust2 and MicrobiomeStat, I welcome potential collaborations and co-authorship opportunities. Please contact me at cafferychen777@tamu.edu for any inquiries.
